TVMaestro will be a programmable remote that can manage a schedule of shows/channels, and skip advertisements by detecting them and switching channels

### Project Members:
1. Gary Quilligan

### Prototype Completed Work:
1. Designed, and implemented a universal remote to facilitate IR communications between TVMaestro and the target TV as well as developed an interace to calibrate the remote to a TV's remote, and then replay those signals back to the TV.

### Current Tasks:
1. Design Prototype - need to progress on git issues/main things to get done
2. Desgin Presentation - need to consider how we will present our work and prepare these (towards the end of break)
	Note: We can rehearse after the slides are completed but before the presentation 11/30
